## Key Topics
* What is Needs Assessment?
* Definition of terms

## Software development process
* Needs assessment
	* Problem acknowledgement
	* Data gathering
	* Data analysis
* Solution development
* Design
* Development
* Implementation

## Needs Assessment is...

* FUCKING COMIC SANS
	* EVERYWHERE
* Data-gathering for the purpose of identifying problems or resolving discrepancies
* Discovering the nature of the problem, its constraints, possible solutions, and an agreed upon course of action
* We are like investigative reporters.
	* We must understand the problem
	* We must convey our understanding to others
	* We may suggest alternatives

## Discrepancy

* Difference between what /is/ and what /should be/
	* The /is/ is called the "actual"
	* The /should be/ is called the "optimal"

## Problems vs. Opportunity

* Problem:
	* Baseline/optimal remains constant
	* Actual drops
* Opportunity:
	* Baseline/optimal increases
	* Actual remains constant

## The dreaded car example

* Opportunities for improvement in lots of areas
	* Glass
	* Brakes
	* Aerodynamics

## Discrepancies

* Problems
	* Optimal is same
	* Actual has changed
	* A current system has "broken down"
	* It cannot perform as it once did
	* Causes
		* Deteriorating skills
		* Deteriorating environment
		* External forces
	* Evidence
		* Sales are down
		* Production is slipping
* Opportunities
	* When the goal has been changed, causing the system to change
	* Nothing is wrong, but there are ways to do better.
		* Actual is same
		* Optimal has changed
	* Suggested by
		* New technologies
		* Drive for improvement
	* Evidenced by
		* Sales are down
		* Loss of market share
		* Not many direct measures

* Causes of both
	* Why has the Optimal or Actual changed?
	* Is the perceived change real?

Analyze who's involved.

Incremental vs Radical change

## Information we need

* Optimals: "goals" (define very carefully/specifically)
* Actuals: current performance
* Feelings of stakeholders
* Causes: reason(s) for discrepancy
* Barriers: hindrances to progress toward goals
* Solutions: potential ways to reduce the "gap"

## Example: printing

* People in a nearby building are having trouble printing.
* Actuals:
	* Some delay on Macs (up to 1/2 hour)
	* Some things never print and are never found
	* PCs good in most offices
* Optimals:
	* All printing accounted for
	* Printers respond in &lt;4 minutes
* Feelings:
	* An important issue because time is always of the essence
	* Frustration, nerves
* Causes
	* Too much network traffic? No, PCs worked fine
	* Incompatibility in hardware/software? Nope, it worked before
* Solutions
	* More printers? (No. You'll just have more printers you can't print to)
	* Individual office printers (inkjets) -- too expensive in the long run
	* Printers for each platform (networking solves this)
	* "better" network (you really can't...)
	* Write software
	* Buy software
	* New building (actually happened 10 years later)
	* Live with it
* What this is
	* An example of overthinking.

## How do we get information?

* Interviews: face-to-face meetings that exhange information
* Focus groups: set of questions asked by one person of a small group
* Observation and participation: watching what people do, becoming a member of the system of study
* Frequency counts/measurement: count how often something occurs
* Extant data analysis: analyzing what is already collected
