# Observations
* Measurements
* Operational definitions
* Detached observation
* Participant observation

## Measuring success
* How do we measure success of a project?
* Consider the following simple project:
    * Write a program that will allow the user to enter their name and will then greet them with "Hello".
* How do we measure the success?
    * Meets spec and takes 1 year to write?
    * Just says "Hello" with no personalization and is completed in an hour?
* When measuring, we need to precisely identify what we *are* measuring, and what we *are not* measuring

## Measurement
* Determine what's important and how to measure it
* Importance is more important than any measurement
* Need to know what problem is
* Need several passes to figure out problem and what to measure

## Measurement Systems
* Length
* Weight
* Speed
* Politeness
* When an accepted measure doesn't exist, create one
* use constructs
    * something that may more really exist in a tangible sense, but useful to pretend
* what are some constructs for politeness

## Operation definition
* Definition of something in terms of what we want to measure
* Remember that what we are measuring may or may not be something tangible
* Not an absolute truth - agreed to by parties involved for purpose at hand
