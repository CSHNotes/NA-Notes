# Observations
* Measurements
* Operational definitions
* Detached observation
* Participant observation

## Measuring success
* How do we measure success of a project?
* Consider the following simple project:
    * Write a program that will allow the user to enter their name and will then greet them with "Hello".
* How do we measure the success?
    * Meets spec and takes 1 year to write?
    * Just says "Hello" with no personalization and is completed in an hour?
* When measuring, we need to precisely identify what we *are* measuring, and what we *are not* measuring

## Operational definitions

* Tension
	* Nervousness
	* Eyes darting around
	* Throbbing muscles

## Measurement
* In order to know what is important, we need to know what the problem is. But to know what the problem is, we need to take measurements.
* This is not a 1-shot deal. You need several passes to zero in on what the problem is and what to measure. It is a process.
* Determine what's important and how to measure it
* Importance is more important than any measurement
* Need to know what problem is
* Need several passes to figure out problem and what to measure

## Measurement Systems
* Which of these is different?
	* Length
	* Weight
	* Speed
	* Politeness
		* One of these things is not like the other things, one of these things just doesn't belong......
* When an accepted measure doesn't exist, create one
* To do this, we use constructs
	* something that may not really exist in a tangible sense, but it's useful to pretend it does.
* What are some constructs for politeness?
	* Smiling
	* Looking at the person you're speaking to

## Buying a product
* Rubbing
* Lifting
* Holding near
* Price tag look
* Smell

## Operational definition
* An OPDEF is the definition of something in terms of what we want to measure
* Remember that what we are measuring may or may not be something tangible
* Not an absolute truth - agreed to by parties involved for the purpose at hand
