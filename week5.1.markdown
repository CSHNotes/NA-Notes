# Defining observation

* Observation is "watching 'life in action'"
* Detached observer
	* "Secret admirer"
	* Observed people don't know they're being watched
* Active participant
	* "Under cover"
	* Observed people don't know why they're being watched

## Detached Observation

Pros:

* Easier to remain anonymous
* Easier to remain focused
* Clear constructs

Cons:

* More difficult to measure "correct" items
* No intimate knowledge -- facts only
	* No knowledge of people/personalities

## Active Participation

Pros

* More complete understanding of data
* Easier to know what to measure

Cons

* Easy to get "sucked in"
* More difficult to avoid contamination
* Takes longer

## The Observation Process

1. Pinpointing
1. Counting
1. Charting

### Pinpointing

* Constructs and observational definitions
	* Specifying behaviors to study
	* Defining them
	* Reaching agreement on how to measure
* Assumptions
	* You can have a good idea of what you're looking for before you start
	* Things can be defined so that they can be counted

### Counting

* Going into the field
	* Determine the rate at which behaviors occur
	* Be surreptitious
* Recording (and developing instruments)
	* Measure the amount of behavior
	* Count both tangible and intangible things
	* Take notes
* Assumptions
	* The human is an accurate recording instrument
	* Entering the environment does not affect it

### Charting

* Raw data
* Standardization/normalization
	* Incidents per hour
	* Totals per person
* Analysis
	* Statistically analyzing data
* Presentation
	* Tables
	* Pie charts
	* Clustered bar charts
	* Box and whiskers charts

# Examples

## Blackjack

* 8 casinos, with 10 blackjack dealers each
* Want to find behaviors related to "large take" vs. "small take"
* Several 15-minute observations
* Raw data:
	* Number of dealers: large take 49, small take 23
	* Minutes observed: 720, 350
	* Hands dealt: 528, 192
	* Verbal quality
		* Value added: 58 (17%), 15 (11%)
		* Politeness: 147 (43%), 49 (36%)
		* Indifferent: 123 (36%), 59 (43%)
		* Rudeness:	14 (4%), 15 (11%)
	* Hands/dealer/hour: 44, 33
	* % value added or polite: 60%, 46%
	* % indifferent or rude: 40%, 54%

## Sales
* Comparison of 3 salespeople
* Raw data:
	* Mike, Pete, Larry
	* Number of sales: 6, 7, 6
	* Small talk bursts: 7, 3, 3
	* "Anything else today"? 4, 8, 2
	* Specific add-on item: 1, 3, 5
	* Total banter: 12, 14, 10
	* Add on $: $11.10, $14.70, $32.16
	* Add on $/sale: $1.85, $2.10, $5.36

## Participant observation
1. Plan to spend an extended amount of time in the field
1. Gain admission to the group. This is sometimes done with the help of an "inside" person.
1. Take "coatroom" notes
1. Write up field notes on a daily basis
	* As soon as possible after interaction
	* Away from setting
	* "Book without a plot"
1. Occasionally, field notes are reviewed while the observation is ongoing. Be careful!
1. Data is analyzed by interacting with the field notes over extended periods of time.
1. Final report will be largely narrative, designed to add to understanding of situation via rich description.

### Examples

* Undercover police work
* Informant
* Others?

## Another angle

* We've discussed being a "Detached Observer" vs. an "Active Participant"
* Another way to discuss observations is "Scientific" vs. "Naturalistic"

### Scientific paradigm

* Experimentation confirms (or rejects) hypothesis
* Control external influences
* Isolate variables of study
* Researcher has no effect on situation
* One truth to be uncovered
* Normally quite structured/methodical
* More quantitative than qualitative

### Naturalistic paradigm

* Assumption is that we can get better information by viewing people and things while in their "native habitat"
* Extensive field study
* Immersion field
* Multiple realities
	* People, personalities, roles
* Researcher affects the field and is also affected by it (active participation only)
* Often unstructured
* More qualitative than quantitative

### Adversarial paradigm
* Cross examination / triangulation
* Truth is found by balancing claims
* Example: legal system

### Judgmental paradigm
* Sensing by humans with appropriate background
* Sometimes, depending on what it is you're judging, called a connoisseur
* Example: Olympics

* Remember:
	* Emergent data = data you did NOT expect
	* Extant data   = data that ALREADY EXISTED
