# Observation
* watching "life in action"
* Detached observer
    * "Secret admirer"
    * Observed people don't know they're being watched
* Active participant
    * "Under cover"
    * Observed people don't know why they're being watched

## Detached Observation
Pros:
* Easier to remain anonymous
* Easier to remain focused
* Clear constructs
Cons:
* More difficult to measure "correct" items
* No intimate knowledge -- facts only
    * No knowledge of people/personalities

## Active Participation
Pros
* More complete understanding of data
* Easier to know what to knowledge
Cons
* Easy to get "sucked in"
* More difficult to avoid contamination
* Takes longer

## Process
### Pinpointing
* Constructs and observational definitions
    * Specifying behaviors to study
    * Defining them
    * Reaching agreement on how to measure
* Assumptions
    * You can have a good idea of what you're looking for before you start
    * Things can be defined so that they can be counted
### Counting
* Going into the field
    * Determine the rate at which behaviors occur
    * Be surreptitious
* Recording (and developing instruments)
    * Measure the amount of behavior
    * Count both tangible and intangible things
    * Take notes
* Assumptions
    * The human is an accurate recording instrument
    * Entering the environment does not affect it
### Charting
* Raw data
* Standardization/normalization
    * Incidents per hour
    * Totals per person
* Analysis
    * Statistically analyzing data
* Presentation
    * Tables
    * Pie charts
    * Clustered bar charts
    * Box and whiskers charts
