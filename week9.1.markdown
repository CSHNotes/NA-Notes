# Why sample?
We want to generalize about a whole class of people. This group is called the *population*.

A subset of the population is called a *sample*.

We measure the characteristics of the sample, and hope to infer about the characteristics of the population.

The question is: how close are the estimates (inferences) likely to be?
	In 1936, Literary Digest predicted Landon, 57% to 43% based on a
	poll of 2.4 million people. Roosevelt won by 62% to 38%.

## Who are you trying to generalize about?

1. Small group - survey the whole population
1. Large group - select a random sample
1. Unless you ask everyone, it's always a guess

## Sampling Types

### Convenience Sampling

Non-random, but hopefully representative of the population

Random sampling allows for better generalizations and enables us to do some fancy math

### Systematic Sampling

Choose a number, get a list and select every Nth person

### Stratified Sampling

In out population, there are 70% athletes and 30% party people. So we want to sample accordingly.

### Cluster Sampling

Unit of analysis is a naturally occurring group rather than individuals
	e.g. : I want to know somehting about all 18 year olds in Rochester, but I don't have a list...
	Divide the city into areas of 16 square blocks. Select area(s) at random. All 18 year olds in that
	area are sampled.

## Bias

### Selection bias

Select group with bias. Respondents were mailed surveys based on telephone books and club memberships. The rich favored Landon; the poor, Roosevelt.

The differences between characteristics of sample and those of the population is called sampling error. Largest error occurs with smallest samples.

### Non-response bias

Upper and lower classes do not respond to surveys, so the middle class is over-represented. Generally, response rate is about 16-36% for mailed
surveys; 75% rate for personal interviews.

### Volunteer bias

More intelligent, affluent less likely to do surverys
	High SES, need more approval, more compliant

# Developing a survey

1. Purpose: questions you want to answer
1. Respondents/Population
1. Method of collection
1. Sampling plan/consideration
1. Develop questionnaire
1. Pilot test
1. Administer
1. Administer follow-ups
1. Analyze

# Survey tips

1. Keep it short - 1 page, not more than 2
1. Consider visual aspects (font size, whitespace)
1. Group similar topics together
1. Start with something interesting
1. Start with easy items if controversial
1. Include a purpose (cover) paragraph - who you are, what might be done with the data, purpose, etc.
1. Getting attitudes
1. Triangulating data
1. It's questionable whether people can accurately report data about themselves at other points in time.
1. Most what you will get is nominal data and should be normalized
