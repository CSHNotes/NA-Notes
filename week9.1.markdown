# Why sample?
We want to generalize about a whole class of people. This group is called the *population*.

A subset of the population is called a *sample*.

We measure the characteristics of the sample, and hope to infer about the characteristics of the population.

The question is: how close are the estimates?

## Who are you trying to generalize about?

1. Small group - survey the whole population
1. Large group - select a random sample
1. Unless you ask everyone, it's always a guess

## Sampling Types

### Convenience Sampling
Non-random, but hopefully representative of the population

Random sampling allows for better generalizations

### Systematic Sampling

Choose a number, get a list and select every Nth person

### Stratified Sampling

In out population, there are 70% athletes and 30% party people. So we want to sample accordingly.

### Cluster Sampling

Unit of analysis is a naturally occurring group rather than individuals

## Bias

### Selection bias
Select group with bias.

### Non-response bias
Upper and lower classes do not respond to surveys

### Volunteer bias
More intelligent, affluent less likely to do surverys

# Developing a survey

1. Purpose: questions you want to answer
1. Respondents/Population
1. Method of collection
1. Sampling plan/consideration
1. Develop questionnaire
1. Pilot test
1. Administer
1. Administer follow-ups
1. Analyze

# Survey tips

1. Keep it short
1. Consider visual aspects
1. Group questions and topics
1. Start with something interesting
1. Start with easy items if controversial
1. Include a purpose paragraph
1. Getting attitudes
1. Triangulating data
1. It's questionable whether people can accurately report data about themselves at other points in time.
1. Most what you will get is nominal data and should be normalized
