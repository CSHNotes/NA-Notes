# The "Why We Sometimes Fail" article

* Keep it... there will be excerpts on the midterm.

# How do we gather information?

* Interviews - Face-to-face meetings that exchange information
* Focus Groups - Set of questions asked by one person of a small group
* Observation and Participation - Watching what people do; become a member of the system of study
* Frequency Counts/Measurement - Count how often something occurs
* Extant Data Analysis - Analyze what data you already have
* Surveys - Gather data from a subset of the population to make judgements about the entire population
* Experiments - Conducting controlled activities for the purpose of collecting data
* Brainstorming - Using groups of stakeholders to propose multiple creative ideas
* Personal Knowledge - Using what you already know from experience or study. BE CAREFUL!

# Example - United Way

* United Way volunteers aren't considered sufficiently "helpful" around agency offices because they can't operate word processing or databsae programs
	* Problem or opportunity?
		* Both!
	* How should we collect information?
	* Where should we get the information?

# Where do we get information?

* Subject Matter Experts (SME)
* Extant data (existing records and documents)
	* Emergent data - relative data that surfaces, that you didn't expect
	* And then there's extant data that we don't know about, and is thus emergent to us
* Executives
* Supervisors/Managers
* Job incumbents/workers
* Customers
* Competitors
* Vendors
* Work Products

# Barriers

* What is getting in the way of performance?
* What might get in the way?
* What is causing the gap between actuals and optimals?

"In defining barriers, you seek the cause(s) of current problems and anticipate what might become a problem. The search for this information acknowledges the complex drivers of individual and organizational success."

## 5 Types of Barriers

1. Skills and Knowledge
	* They don't know how to do it
		* RP just bought a Saab and it has a GUI for changing the radio station
	* They don't remember how to do it
		* How many of us remember how to find the mean for 3-Sigma? None. Because we don't use it.
	* Too much to know
		* Google
	* Information too volatile
		* 
	* Examples:
		* Teachers leave their computers in the closet because they don't know how to use them
		* Students struggle with programming because they can't use a debugger
1. Motivation
	* Don't know why
	* Don't believe they can
	* Don't think they should
	* Examples:
		* Clerks don't see value of new computer system; the old one works just fine.
		* Engineers don't use the new CAD system; believe they can hand-draw just as fast.
		* Admins don't use e-mail monitoring program because they believe it is an invasion of privacy.
1. Environment
	* Don't have the right tools/equipment
	* Don't have time
	* Don't have space
	* Examples:
		* Documentation and directories housed in another building
		* Staff is forced to use old-style furniture with computers and monitors
1. Incentives
	* Aren't asked
	* Doing it is a hassle
	* Doing it is ignored
	* No reward (not doing it is rewarded)
	* Examples:
		* The more work you do, the more work you get
		* Reports of problems are not acted upon
1. Communication
	* Not told how to do it
	* Not told right way to do it
	* Not my job
	* Don't know written/unwritten rules
	* Examples:
		* Workers disciplined for not doing the job properly
		* Secretary setting up a meeting with the wrong people
1. Fear of failure (not really on the flowchart/sheet, but it's a thing, says RP)
	* People don't like to fail
	* Change represents an opportunity to embrace something new

# Problem Solving

"Don't forget to assess!"

## Topics
* Keys to success
	1. Continually break the issue into smaller pieces
		1. Write problem down in the form of a question
		1. Break that question into smaller questions
		1. Determine what information would provide acceptable evidence of an answer
		1. Determine how to get that information
	1. Recognize that people tell you symptoms, not problems
	1. Smile and listen while they tell you the solution - it's another symptom

## Breaking it down

1. Write problem in the form of a question.
1. Break that question into smaller, more precise questions.
1. Determine what information would provide acceptable evidence of an answer.
1. Determine how to get that information.

## Example: "Will it blend"?
* We want to know if the "blended" teaching approach will improve teaching at RIT

	* Intuitive
	* Common sense
	* Maintains focus
	* Risk taker

	* Familiarity with people involved
	* Organized
	* Methodical
	* Listens well
