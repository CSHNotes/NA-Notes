# Groups

## Group decision making

    * Commitment by all members

* Majority Vote
    * Good when time is lacking
    * Not all members buy-in
* Minority Vote
    * When not everyone can meet
    * When only a few members have resources
    * Unresolved conflict can be a problem
    * No buy-in or commitment
    * Fast and easy
