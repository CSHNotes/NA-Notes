# Groups

## Group decision making
* Consensus
    * + Most effective, but takes most time
    * + Commitment by all members
    * + Uses resources of all members
    * - Hard to reach consensus
    * - Group make-up is poor
    * - Takes time
* Majority Vote
    * + Good when time is lacking
    * - Not all members buy-in
* Minority Vote
    * + When not everyone can meet
    * + When only a few members have resources
    * - Unresolved conflict can be a problem
    * - No buy-in or commitment
    * + Fast and easy
    * - Lost group benefits

### Building consensus
* Consensus seeking is the process of making decisions based on agreement of the group rather than by voting
* The advantage of using consensus is that everyone becomes vested in the decision or the outcome
* Voting is win/lose
* Consensus is sometimes a win/win
    * Someone may choose to concede
* Consensus vs. Compromise
* Everyone must have an equal opportunity to express and discuss their ideas
* Focus on objectives
    * Stay away from side issues
    * Focus on specifics that are common to the group
    * Work toward clarification of ideas

    * Address all concerns
    * Ask if there are objections
